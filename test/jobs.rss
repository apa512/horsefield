Built on Ethereum, Aragon, and IPFS.</em></div><div>$70000 - $140000</div><div><a href="https://district0x.io/">https://district0x.io/</a></div><br /><div><h3>district0x</h3><p>district0x is a global organization developing the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps). Built using Ethereum, Aragon, and IPFS, district0x is a network of marketplace dApps known as districts. Our mission is to decentralize the ownership structure of the world's marketplace by providing a platform for the creation, operation, and governance of peer-to-peer marketplaces. Using cutting edge technologies, we hope to bring more democratic and equitable businesses to the internet. </p><p>We launched our first product, a job board for freelancers, Ethlance.com, in January of 2017. After completing a fundraiser in July of 2017, we launched our second marketplace, Namebazaar.io, a peer-to-peer marketplace for the exchange domain names registered via the Ethereum Name Service. We're looking to expand our team in order to accelerate the development of new districts as well as several integrations, partnerships, and developer toolkits. </p><h4>Summary of Position:</h4><p>The district0x tech stack is driven in the backend by smart contracts developed in Solidity and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, and in the front end by Clojurescript served via the Interplanetary File System. </p><p>As a Clojurescript Developer, your primary goal is to build front end interfaces for new districts and extend libraries to serve user-made districts. The secondary goal is to create new and secure services written in Solidity, and develop automated test cases for these services. Clojurescript Developers should work independently when building, but must collaborate with other developers in order to check each other's work and maintain the highest standards of code quality. A great Clojurescript Developer will go above and beyond by building new and unique user experiences, and automating any routines for the business at large.</p><h4>Key Responsibilities:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Establish a clean and efficient development, test, and production environment.</li>
  <li>Deliver best-in-class front-end solutions in Clojure.</li>
  <li>Write and implement test suites covering the full range of code functionality.</li>
  <li>Collaborate with the team to define architecture, quality standards, and best practices.</li>
  <li>Diligently document all aspects of open-source contributions.</li>
  <li>Create unique solutions to dApp-specific user experience challenges.</li>
  <li>Build software that is FUN to use!</li>
</ul><h4>The ideal candidate will have:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>3+ years of experience developing front-end web applications</li>
  <li>Working knowledge of Clojure/Clojurescript</li>
  <li>Experience with re-frame libraries</li>
  <li>A passion for cryptocurrencies and other peer-to-peer technologies</li>
  <li>Experience building smart contracts in Solidity</li>
  <li>A deep understanding of how the Ethereum network and blockchains operate</li>
</ul><h4>Additionally, you MUST be able to:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Speak and write English fluently</li>
  <li>Communicate proactively (we are 100% remote!)</li>
  <li>Work independently towards deadlines</li>
  <li>Accept a salary paid in Ether</li>
</ul><p>At district0x, we value above all trust in our fellow contributors. Everyone sets their own hours and expectations, we work together towards unanimous goals. If you would thrive in this environment, send your resume to <a href="mailto:talent@district0x.io">talent@district0x.io</a>. For bonus points, find theis posting and apply via Ethlance.com.

<![CDATA[<div><h1>Clojure Engineer</h1><div class="company-name">Red Pineapple Media | Berlin</div><div><a href="https://www.redpineapplemedia.com">https://www.redpineapplemedia.com</a></div><br /><div><h1>Want to work with Clojure in Berlin?</h1><p>Red Pineapple Media distributes video advertising to more than 50 markets, and we've been expanding consistently since we started 6 years ago.</p><p>Our engineering team is built around a strong culture of teamwork. Code reviews, joint presentations and group decisions are standard for us. We'll often pick up the projector and do pair programming on the big wall of our office, or just sit together in one of our quiet rooms to prepare architectural changes or to give peer-to-peer feedback.</p><p>We care deeply about continual improvement, and have an RFC process in place to enable team members to influence our evolving standard and practices.</p><p>We're in an exciting phase right now as we're transitioning to programmatic buying and selling of advertisement space. The number of non-trivial challenges ahead is large, and the learning opportunities rich. From intelligently bidding for advertisement space in real time, to applying clustering and classification techniques to improve ad targeting, our future is full of opportunities for functional-programming goodness</p><h2>What attitude are we looking for?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You have a strong sense of ownership and responsibility;</li>
  <li>You're ready to work independently, clearly define problems, and objectively evaluate tradeoffs of potential solutions;</li>
  <li>You're naturally motivated and proud of doing great work;</li>
  <li>You believe that clear communication (including documentation and Git history) are a key part of good software engineering;</li>
  <li>Your thought process is guided by rationalism and evidence rather than gut feeling or tradition;</li>
  <li>You enjoy diversity (including differences of opinion), and have a humble attitude when engaging in discussions;</li>
  <li>You sincerely welcome constructive criticism, and communicate with regard for the feelings of others.</li>
</ul><h2>What do we value in people?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Code needs to be read by humans, so you write code and documentation optimising for clarity;</li>
  <li>You understand the importance of testing and automation, and avoiding repeating the same mistakes;</li>
  <li>You get things done not only when starting exciting new projects but also when refactoring inelegant legacy code;</li>
  <li>You're ready to work daily with Linux systems, AWS, Git, Docker and a steadily growing Microservice infrastructure;</li>
  <li>You're ready to embrace the DevOps way of life, because an Engineer's work doesn't end after 'git push';</li>
  <li>Your studies were in computer science, mathematics, engineering or a related area;</li>
  <li>Alternatively: you have an awesome GitHub profile to show off :-)</li>
  <li>You have worked with Clojure, ClojureScript, or other functional programming languages (and you're interested in learning Clojure!);</li>
  <li>You have worked with distributed systems and have dealt with problems related to concurrency, performance and fault tolerance;</li>
  <li>Curiosity is a constant in you. You don't settle for the same language or paradigm for too long and are eager to experiment and learn new things.</li>
</ul><h2>What we offer</h2><p>Never a dull moment. Besides writing code, we also do our own DevOps, testing, retrospectives, planning, architecture, peer-to-peer evaluation, coffee and cooking</p><h3>Small teams, lots of freedom</h3><p>Every few months we organise in small teams around well-defined business objectives, and we have complete ownership over the approach and process used to achieve them. This includes: planning, work methodology, design, development and maintenance. We also decide when and how to tackle technical debt, and we are the sole owners of these decisions. Then, after some time, we reset the teams and choose new challenges to work on.</p><h3>A safe haven for functional programmers</h3><p>Even if your background is in non-functional programming, if you want to do functional programming then Red Pineapple Media is the place for you. You'll find as many challenges here as learning opportunities. You'll also have the chance to try new things and explore. We regularly hold research weeks where you can spend your time investigating and building anything you want.</p><h3>Friendly environment plus quiet rooms</h3><p>We regularly hold team breakfasts, barbecues, and ping-pong matches. We're super animal friendly: 4 dog owners, 2 vegans, 1 vegetarian and a cat-loving CEO. Naturally, dogs are welcome in the office. But we also optimise for focus and have quiet rooms where you can do power-naps, meditate or just work in isolation.</p><h3>Do what you want - and own it</h3><p>We believe that when given independence and room to grow, people tend to do great things. If you want to learn something new, fix that annoying Elasticsearch performance problem or focus on creating nicer looking brandings or reports, it's up to you. As long as our business objectives are achieved, you own and control your time and what to do with it.</p><h3>Compensation</h3><p>Depends on experience: we're currently looking for both intermediate and senior engineers.</p><h2>About Red Pineapple Media</h2><p>Red Pineapple Media is a passionate, dedicated team of content and marketing professionals connecting advertisers, publishers, and consumers all over the globe. We're driven by one simple goal: deliver campaigns that mutually benefit the advertiser, publisher, and the consumer. It's a strategy that has seen us successfully help over 300 advertisers increase their exposure and boost online media ROI in more than 56 markets -- and counting.</p><p>You can learn more about us at <a href="https://www.redpineapplemedia.com/">www.redpineapplemedia.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

Our organisation encourages us to learn and cultivate a sharing culture through teamwork, regular talks and open-source contributions. All team members are given the possibility to pursue their own research goals or attend field-specific conferences. Close collaboration and shared goals connect us with other computing centres and research labs in the federal state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany.</p><h1>Our project</h1><p>Research is more and more data-driven, with a rapidly growing amount of large sets of 3D data, which creates a demand for interactive remote visualisation. The service we create will allow scientists to efficiently analyse data. It is unique in that it is focused on a scalable container-first cloud platform, specifically targeted at the visualisation needs of researchers in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. We lower the entry barrier by focusing on usability and a user-friendly web frontend, provide building blocks for bringing custom user-specific tools onto our platform and encourage sharing within the community by promoting open source and open data.</p><h1>You will</h1>
