<summary type="html" ><![CDATA[<p>Launched in 2016, Habito is transforming the mortgage industry through innovation and cutting-edge technology. We are the UK&#039;s free online mortgage broker backed by Atomico, Ribbit Capital and Mosaic Ventures, with angel investors including Transferwise CEO Taavet Hinrikus, Funding Circle&rsquo;s founder Samir Desai and Yuri Milner, influential tech investor.</p>

<p>We are building a great brand synonymous with great customer service, ease and transparency. Simple, fast and honest, coupled with no fees, and no misinformation.</p>

<p>Our team is super-smart, ambitious, collaborative and friendly. We work hard, play hard and learn fast. This is a great opportunity to help steer, shape and mould our business.</p>

<p><strong>Are you excited? Come and make your home at Habito!</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Role</strong></p>

<p>We are looking for a full-time senior software engineer to join our team of full-stack engineers. Our core development values are strong, static typing and correctness, rigorous automation (in both testing and infrastructure) and everyone having a say.</p>

<p>The stack: On the back end we have an HTTP API written in Haskell (and built using stack) with PostgreSQL serving as the persistence layer. All of our data is event sourced thanks to PostgreSQL&#039;s great support for relational and blob data (e.g. jsonb) and some in-house libraries for handling ES/CQRS in a type-safe (or what we believe to be, as far as possible) manner. We lean heavily on GHC and its extensions and are also using some of the bigger power-to-weight-ratio players like lens and conduit.</p>

<p>The front end is written in PureScript on top of React and Redux (the bindings to which are our own but are both quite thin and based on the design of purescript-react and later pux).</p>

<p>Infrastructure wise we are sitting atop AWS and using Docker to manage containment. Jenkins manages continuous integration and deployment using a combination of AWS&#039; Java SDK and some management code written in Scala</p>

<p>While we&#039;re a technology company first and foremost, initially we&#039;re trying to make the UK mortgage brokering market a better place. This means building and maintaining our website, but it also involves a slurry of behind-the-scenes work integrating lenders, insurers, conveyancers and all the other players in the space as we seek to introduce robust automation into what is currently so many manual processes. Slack bots, job queues, working around the fact that some actors don&#039;t have APIs -- you&#039;ll get to handle it all!</p>

<ul>
<li>Work on our back-end software, written in Haskell and our front-end web 
applications, written in PureScript, HTML and CSS.</li>
<li>Help maintain and extend our infrastructure, hosted in AWS using technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.</li>
<li>Use tools such as QuickCheck, Tasty and HUnit to produce reliable, well-tested software.</li>
<li>Work with our product and design teams to produce customer-centric experiences that excite and delight.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Candidate</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A passionate developer who cares about clean code and code quality; a full-stack polyglot</li>
<li>An experienced engineer familiar with automated testing and deployment</li>
<li>Experienced with functional programming and domain-driven design or simply interested and capable of learning on the job</li>
<li>Someone who cares about UX and UI; you have a fundamental aversion to ugliness in product</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And Finally......</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Competitive salary &amp; share options</li>
<li>Career development, coaching &amp; training</li>
<li>Free catered lunches, snacks &amp; team bonding</li>
<li>Bupa Healthcare &amp; Life Assurance</li>
<li>Contributory pension scheme</li>
<li>Bi-weekly massages with Urban Massage</li>
<li>Unlimited Holiday</li>
<li>Cycle to Work Scheme</li>
<li>Childcare Vouchers</li>
</ul>

<li>Highly intelligent, supportive team.</li>
<li>20+ holidays per year.  </li>
<li>Support for conferences &amp; other tech related education. </li>
</ul>

<h2>A Typical Day</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Start off writing a feature that requires elm-ports. These can be tricky, so you
pair with another developer who has shipped such code before.</p></li>
<li><p>After lunch you&#039;re requested to review a Pull Request that fixes a bug you accidentally
introduced a couple weeks back. There&#039;s no blame, instead some discussion about 
how our tests and review process could have caught this earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>The afternoon is spent with the Product guys around a whiteboard. You&#039;re helping
them sketch out a realistic wire-frame for a feature we plan to deliver in a couple
of weeks.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Some Tech we like:</h1>

<p>We&#039;re more interested in a willingness and ability to learn than what you currently know. But in case you&#039;re interested in the stack we&#039;re using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Haskell</li>
<li>Elm</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Python / scikit-learn </li>
<li>Tensorflow / Deep learning</li>

<updated>2018-05-02T04:42:04-04:00</updated>
<summary type="html" ><![CDATA[<p>Reaktor is a global strategy, design, and engineering company, with a one-year-old (yay!) office in Amsterdam. <strong>Our team is currently looking for developers who are really, truly, damn good.</strong></p>

<p>We are in the business of making our clients (AFKLM, HBO, Michael Kors, Supercell, Sanoma, to name a few) succeed in their digital ventures. Our teams in Amsterdam, New York City, Helsinki, and Tokyo consist of propellerheads who do everything from hardcore software development to sophisticated brand and concept design.</p>

<p>The Amsterdam squad is essentially a small bunch of settlers who operate with the support of an international company. We love going to meetups, drinking sour ales in De Pijp, and kicking it with some of the biggest consumer brands out there.</p>

<p><strong>What we&rsquo;ve got for you:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s be real. Compared to the mothership in Helsinki, we&rsquo;re still on the side of minuscule. But! Our projects are bigger than us, and you will be working in a team of 4 to 8 top-notch Reaktorians.</li>
<li>When we hire you, we trust you. That means you call the shots when it comes to selecting your gear, tech, and ways of working.</li>
<li>We try our darnedest to make sure that every morning, you&rsquo;ll come to work with a smile on your face, feeling like you can make a difference.</li>
<li>Naturally, necessities like equipment and compensation will be taken care of in a manner that all parties maintain said smile.</li>
<li>We promise to send you to the Great White North (Finland) for orientation (bring a winter jacket). There&rsquo;s a chance we&rsquo;ll send you somewhere else as well if you like (jacket recommendation still open).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What you need to win the game:</strong></p>

<p>Mad skill in at least a few programming languages you like. Here are some things we are currently drooling over: <strong>functional programming, Node.js, Clojure, React, Swift, SQL, NoSQL, general bleeding edge stuff.</strong>
- Willingness to be responsible for your work, development and career path. Don&rsquo;t worry: we&rsquo;ll have your back in whatever you want to achieve, only it&rsquo;s up to you to keep the end goal straight.
- Burning desire to improve, grow, get better, <em>insert more synonyms</em>. It&rsquo;s okay to not be perfect.</p>

<p>All in all, we&rsquo;re a simple lot. We believe in continuous learning, rapid iterations, and <a href="https://www.reaktor.com/blog/dear-client-our-autonomy-competitive-advantage/">fully autonomic teams that have the means to accomplish their goals and make their own decisions</a>. We don&rsquo;t believe in unnecessary hierarchy, bureaucracy, staying in the comfort zone.</p>

<p>Does all this resonate with you? If so, we can&rsquo;t wait to meet up.</p>

<p>Details of any open source projects, GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repositories, and whatever else you deem necessary, are highly regarded. If you&rsquo;re still unsure, <a href="https://www.reaktor.com/blog/magical_fairy_land/">let Adam explain what you can expect from interviewing with us</a>.</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<link href="https://functionaljobs.com/jobs/9026-ocaml-server-side-developer-at-ahrefs" ></link>
<id>urn:uuid:cd0aa60f-367a-6a20-cf75-da1cbadc517c</id>
<updated>2017-06-30T15:59:39-04:00</updated>
<summary type="html" ><![CDATA[<h2>What we need</h2>

<p>Ahrefs is looking for a backend developer with a deep understanding of networks, distributed systems, OS fundamentals and taste for simple and efficient architectural designs. Our backend is implemented mostly in OCaml and some C++, as such proficiency in OCaml is very much appreciated, otherwise a strong inclination to intensively learn OCaml in a short term will be required. Understanding of functional programming in general and/or experience with other FP languages (F#,Haskell,Scala,Scheme,etc) will help a lot. Knowledge of C++ and/or Rust is a plus.</p>

<p>Every day the candidate will have to deal with:</p>

<ul>
<li>10+ petabytes of live data</li>
<li>OCaml</li>
<li>linux</li>
<li>git</li>
</ul>

<p>The ideal candidate is expected to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Independently deal with bugs, schedule tasks and investigate code</li>
<li>Make argumented technical choice and take responsibility for it</li>
<li>Understand the whole technology stack at all levels : from network and userspace code to OS internals and hardware</li>
<li>Handle full development cycle of a single component - i.e. formalize task, write code and tests, setup and support production (devops), resolve user requests</li>
<li>Approach problems with practical mindset and suppress perfectionism when time is a priority</li>
<li>Write flexible maintainable code and adapt to post-launch requirements&rsquo; tweaks </li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements stem naturally from our approach to development with fast feedback cycle, highly-focused personal areas of responsibility and strong tendency to vertical component splitting.</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>Ahrefs runs an internet-scale bot that crawls the whole Web 24/7, storing huge volumes of information to be indexed and structured in a timely fashion. Backend system is powered by a custom petabyte-scale distributed key-value storage to accommodate all that data coming in at high speed. The storage system is implemented in OCaml with thin  performance-critical low-level part in C++. On top of that Ahrefs is building various analytical services for end-users.</p>

<p>We are a small team and strongly believe in better technology leading to better solutions for real-world problems. We worship functional languages and static typing, extensively employ code generation and meta-programming, value code clarity and predictability, and are constantly seeking to automate repetitive tasks and eliminate boilerplate, guided by DRY and following KISS. If there is any new technology that will make our life easier - no doubt, we&#039;ll give it a try. We rely heavily on opensource code (as the only viable way to build maintainable system) and contribute back, see e.g. https://github.com/ahrefs . It goes without saying that our team is all passionate and experienced OCaml programmers, ready to lend a hand and explain that intricate ocamlbuild rule or track a <a href="https://tech.ahrefs.com/skylake-bug-a-detective-story-ab1ad2beddcd">CPU bug</a>.</p>

<p>Our motto is &quot;first do it, then do it right, then do it better&quot;.</p>

<h2>What you get</h2>

<p>We provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>Competitive salary</li>
<li>Informal and thriving atmosphere</li>
<li>First-class workplace equipment (hardware, tools)</li>
<li>Medical insurance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Locations</h2>

<p>Singapore : modern office in CBD</p>

<p>USA : cozy loft in San Francisco downtown</p>
